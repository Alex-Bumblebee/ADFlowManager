## [0.1.7-beta] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Template - Save as template button**: The floppy disk icon is now a visible labeled button "Sauvegarder en template" / "Save as template" for better discoverability.
- **Template - OU saved**: The selected Organizational Unit is now saved in the template and automatically pre-selected when the template is applied.
- **Create User - Group filter toggle**: Added a "Voir sélectionnés" / "View selected" toggle button in the Groups tab. When active, only selected groups are displayed to quickly review the selection.

---

## [0.1.6-beta] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Configurable group loading** (perf): New setting in Active Directory tab - "Load groups on startup". Uncheck to skip `GetGroups()` during initial user load, significantly improving performance on large domains or AD 2012 R2. Groups remain fully accessible via double-click (live load).

---

## [0.1.5-beta] - 2026-02-18

### Improvements/Fixed

- **Theme not respecting settings** (issue #3): Application now applies the theme from Settings on startup instead of following the Windows system theme. Defaults to Dark if no preference is saved
- **Included/Excluded OUs filter** (issue #1): OU filters in Settings now correctly apply to the user list. When Included OUs are configured, AD is scanned only on those specific OUs (targeted `PrincipalContext` per OU) instead of the full domain - significantly faster on large directories. Excluded OUs are filtered by DN on both AD results and cache reads. Cache is automatically invalidated and users reloaded when these filters change on save.
- **OU visibility** (issue #4): Organizational Units are now displayed as `Parent OU → OU Name` (breadcrumb path) in all OU pickers (Settings, Create User, Groups). The full DN is shown as a tooltip.
- **Cache TTL extended to 24h** (issue #2): Cache lifetime slider now goes up to 1440 min (24h) with snap-to-tick marks at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720 and 1440 min.

## [0.1.4-beta] - 2026-02-17

Correction for automatic update (release)

## [0.1.0-beta] - 2026-02-16

**⚠️ Beta Release** - This is a pre-release version for testing purposes. All planned features are complete, but the software may contain bugs.

### 🎉 First Public Beta Release!

ADFlowManager is a modern Active Directory management tool built with .NET 10 and WPF, designed to be significantly faster and more user-friendly than traditional PowerShell-based tools.

**Performance**: Significantly faster than PowerShell cmdlets thanks to native .NET APIs and intelligent caching system.
**Privacy First**: No telemetry, no data collection. Everything runs locally on your infrastructure.
